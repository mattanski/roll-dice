# roll-dice

This repository contains a simple program that simulates the tossing of a dice and a coin using the Random library. The goal of the project is to provide an example of how random generation can be used to simulate random flips of a six-sided die and a coin.

Operation
The program starts the simulation of tossing a die and a coin. The result of the dice roll will be displayed as a number from 1 to 6, while the coin toss will be represented as "Heads" or "Tails".
